			<p>In the 1930's, the first form of recording on a reel to reel was developed, which was on the blatternphone.
			It was very primitive for it's time and was specifically made for just recording speech. Soon after, the magnetophon was developed but was also only developed for speech lasting only 15 minutes.
			Around the end of WWII and the fall of the Axis power, the first reel to reels were discovered by the Americans during the recapture of the European Theatre of WWII. Unkown to this high fidelity recording that the 
			Nazis were developing, Jack Mulin, a member of the U.S. Army Signal Corps, started developing and improving these machines for commercial use. His main hope with this was to develop it for Hollywood movie soundtracks.
			After this, radio show host Bing Crosby saw the potential of using these tape recorders to prerecord his shows. Following this example, studios started using reel to reel recorders for their use.

			<p>Throughout the 1950's to the pre-2000's, analog was considered to be the primary recording format. Lots of famous bands and the most influential bands used reel to reel tape recorders, such as Queen, Led Zepplin, Nirvanna and many many more.
		Some of the greatest records of all time were recorded onto reel to reel. Through time although these recorders have lost interest in studios in favor for a more easier way to record. This has drastically brought down the quality for which analog was known for,
		replicating the analog signal completely. Today, digital is used in almost every proffesional studio around the world. Home studios and other studios are based off their computer now. Effects like reverb, delay, chorus etc. can all be brought out of the signal 
		of a computer. The premier format for recording music is now seen as a subsidary for recording. People still use it though, luckily, and hopefully the true king to recording can be used in the future.
