			<p>Hello and welcome to the analog and digital recording hub for all recording geeks out there. 
	This website discusses the differences between digital (losers) and analog recording and why 
	(so obviously) analog recording is superior in all ways!</p><p>What is recording in the first place?
	Well, it involves the process of recreating the sound waves of instruments, voices, etc. for a listener to enjoy.
	This was first created with the invention of the phonograph, which was able to record sound to wax and play it back 
	through the phongraphs vinyl needle. 
	After much improvisation, the process of using magnetic tape to record to a machine called a reel to reel. 
	This machine was introduced as a inexpensive new way to record
	with higher fidelity and multiple tracks to record on.
	The most notable thing about these tape recorders being that it takes the direct analog signal from the instrument and 
	replicates it in a smooth wave, while digital cannot do this.</p>
