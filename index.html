			<p>Hello and welcome to the analog and digital recording hub for all recording geeks out there. 
	This website discusses the differences between digital (losers) and analog recording and why 
	(so obviously) analog recording is superior in all ways!</p><p>What is recording in the first place?
	Well, it involves the process of recreating the sound waves of instruments, voices, etc. for a listener to enjoy.
	This was first created with the invention of the phonograph, which was able to record sound to wax and play it back 
	through the phongraphs vinyl needle. 
	After much improvisation, the process of using magnetic tape to record to a machine called a reel to reel. 
	This machine was introduced as a inexpensive new way to record
	with higher fidelity and multiple tracks to record on.
	The most notable thing about these tape recorders being that it takes the direct analog signal from the instrument and 
	replicates it in a smooth wave, while digital cannot do this.</p>

			<p>By the 1990's, digital recording was coming into its own (despite the lack of a reliable sampling rate). The lack of RAM and unreliable computers led to computers not being able to surmount the amount of 
			tracks that people wanted on their songs, so analog was still used as the primary format. After the decade and into the 2000's the computer was becoming more and more the primary format for studios. It passed 
			as the primary format, and now sub-par quality has been accepted throughout the industry. Not only that, but compresion, a studio tool, is now also affecting the way the music sounds. Unfortunatley, in the future, 
			this will probably not change, the true quality of an analog recording will never be restored to its rightful place in the music industry.
