			<p>In summary, analog is very obviously the superior recording method. Through the pages you can see the changes that have happened to the industry to supplement convienence. In the end, since when was anything that was of extreme quality easy? Never, so in the end you should always do whats hard in order to produce good content. Analog recording will hopefully go back to its place.</p>
