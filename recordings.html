		<p>This song is a <b>analog recording</b> by singer/songwriter Mac Demarco, the song is called My Kind of Woman. Many people say that there is a chance that the recording will be corrupted while it is being recorded because of the physcial counterparts like dust and such in the air corrupting the tape. This song is an example that that dosen't happen, it is also a very good song very much above a digital recording.
